How to run project:
To run the the project, the run button on Replit needs to be clicked. From there, read the instructions and click anywhere on the screen to proceed to the next screen. The next screen is the game screen, where the text box needs to be clicked to input text. Text can be inputted by typing. Once the word is typed, click anywhere on the screen to see how the word did; at this point the boxes should turn white or green and text should appear below the text box. Click the screen again to clear the boxes; the boxes should now be rainbow each with an image showing part of the Neilson Library. Use the "backspace" key on the keyboard to delete the text, and input another word. If the word is correct, the next and final screen shows the facts that correspond with the word and the program ends there. If over 20 tries have been unsucessful, the program advances to the next screen telling the player they were unsucessful in completing the game, and the program ends there.
