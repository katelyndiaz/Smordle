## Group Contract
_Note: In the space provided below create a group contract with your team. This is where you discuss any norms and rules you want to establish so that everyone works well together.

The group contract is broken into three main parts: timely communication, effort, and responsibility. 
- Timely communication: Respond to the other person within 12 hours about the project, either in person or over text. Also, communicate when a part of the project is completed or if any issues occur that the person needs help resolving. 
- Effort: Put effort into doing your part, i.e when working on code add comments to let the other person know how it works, ensuring all the variables have correct names. Going along with that, ensuring you follow through with the work assigned and make sure the work is done in the time frame agreed to. 
- Responsibility: Complete all the parts in the timeline agreed to, but if you can't make the timeline then take responsibility to talk to the other person about the deadlines. 

**Participation**: We agree to.... "insert what counts as participating"  
_Note: all members must equal share the responsibility of programming (i.e., writing code) and other creative aspects (i.e., research about characters, questions, narratives). Each member must be able to explain ALL parts of the program at demo day and upon submission. If individuals do not participate in programming activities, they may receive a failing grade._

- We agree working on the project includes researching code, troubleshooting the other person's code, going to office hours or tutoring hours for the project, reaching out to the professor/other students, coding, and creating graphics
- We agree to split the work, but tailor our seperate parts to our strengths
  
**Communication**: We agree to...  "insert how you plan to communicate, what medium, how often, etc."

- We agree text will be our main platform of communcation
- We agree we will use text to discuss what needs to be done and what parts each of us should be working on, and when we should have it down
- We agree we will communicate whenever a part of the project is done or an issue arises with the project
- We agree we will check in with each other frequently about their part of the project, and how far they have completed their part

**Meetings**: We agree to....    "insert when you plan to meet, should people arrive on-time, is it come and go, can people miss a meeting, what will happen at the meeting, how long will they be"

- We agree to work together after class on Wednesdays and/or Fridays if both people are avaiable
- We agree to work individually for the most part, but have constant communcation to the other person about the work we are doing
- We agree our meeting schedule is fluid and meetings can happen as frequently as we want, or at any time a group member feels a meeting would be helpful and required
- We agree meetings should be around 1-2 hours in length of time we work on the project, but acknowledge meeting will run longer to provide additonal time to discuss non-CSC topics

**Conduct**: We agree to...     "what are the dos and don'ts for group members, how can each member hold each other accountable"

- We agree to make communication the number one priority
- We agree to talk about any issues that arise
- We agree to ensure each person is taking accountability of their part of the project


**Conflict**: We agree to...    "how will you resolve conflict when it arises, some conflict is normal in any group...you just need a plan ahead of time"

- We agree to reserve time in our meetings to discuss any conflict
- We agree to resolve the conflict by the end of the meeting

**Other**: We agree to...    "anything else?"
