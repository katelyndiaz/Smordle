### Prototype III - Feedback

Thanks for presenting at demo day! I hope you enjoyed seeing all the other projects and got some ideas for how to improve your own. 
Before you make your final submission, please remember to do the following:

- You need to finish your ReadMe.md file.
- Your group contract is still missing.
- A rubric (i.e., list of features and cool stuff) should be added.
- Now is the time to finish your doc strings.
- Finally, don't forget that your Project Video and Individual Project Reflection are both due on May 5th, 2022.

### Prototype II - Feedback

**Headers**: Remember to fully complete before submission 

**Read Me**: Remember to fully complete before submission 

**Group Contract**: Remember to fully complete before submission 

**Sprint Planning**: Complete  

**Code/Program**: I just had a small comment about reducing how many times there is an `else` statement, otherwise looks like you made progress! Looking forward to the finished product. I would highly recommend having instructions for the user, as I was a little confused as to what I was playing or how I should. 

**Design Documents**: Complete

**Test Suite**: Keep working on this!

**Other Comments**: Kep it up!   

### Prototype I - Feedback

**Headers**: You must add the names of your group members (and team name) to every file. 

**Read Me**:Your `readme.md` file is incomplete.   

**Group Contract**: Your Group Contract in `work_log.md` is incomplete. 

**Sprint Planning**: Complete. Good job! 

**Code/Program**: Please meet with Prof. Alicia to discuss the complexity of your project. The code you have so far is good but as it is right now it is a little simple. There is definitely a lot of potential for this project and I'm excited to see how it goes!

**Other Comments**: Make sure to write instructions for your game as you go! And maybe give the user an option to quit the game as they're playing?
